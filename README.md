# RPGLE Program: Data Processing Example
This repository contains an example `RPGLE` program that demonstrates reading data from an input file, processing it, and writing the results to an output file.

## Features
- Reads data from an input file (`INPUTFILE`) using the `ReadInput` procedure.
- Processes each record to double the Quantity field and writes the result to an output file (`OUTPUTFILE`) using the WriteOutput procedure.
- Illustrates basic file I/O operations, data manipulation, and modularization of code using procedures.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Customize the program by specifying the correct file names for inputFile and outputFile.
3. Ensure you have access to the required input and output files.
4. Compile and run the `RPGLE` program using an `RPG` compiler (e.g., IBM Rational Development Studio, IBM i PDM, etc.).
5. Check the output file to view the processed data.

## Important Notes
- This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.
- The program assumes that the input and output files are defined and accessible on the IBM i (AS/400) system.
