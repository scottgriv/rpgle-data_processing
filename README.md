# RPGLE Program: Data Processing Example
This repository contains an example `RPGLE` program that demonstrates reading data from an input file, processing it, and writing the results to an output file.

## Features
- Reads data from an input file (`INPUTFILE`) using the `ReadInput` procedure.
- Processes each record to double the Quantity field and writes the result to an output file (`OUTPUTFILE`) using the WriteOutput procedure.
- Illustrates basic file I/O operations, data manipulation, and modularization of code using procedures.

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Customize the program by specifying the correct file names for inputFile and outputFile.
- Ensure you have access to the required input and output files.
- Compile and run the `RPGLE` program using an `RPG` compiler (e.g., IBM Rational Development Studio, IBM i PDM, etc.).
- Check the output file to view the processed data.

## Important Notes
This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.
The program assumes that the input and output files are defined and accessible on the IBM i (AS/400) system.
